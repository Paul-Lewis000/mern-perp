- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an Execution Context
    - Memory (Variable Environment)
    - Code (Thread of Execution)

- JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language.

- Execution Context
    - Phase 1: Memory Creation Phase
    - Phase 2: Code Execution Phase

- JS manages execution context using Call Stack
