Creating an effective resume as a fresher is crucial to make a strong impression on potential employers. Here are some dos and don'ts, along with a simple framework to follow:

**Dos:**

1. **Start with a strong summary:** Begin your resume with a concise summary that highlights your skills, enthusiasm, and career goals. Tailor it to the specific job you're applying for.

2. **Use a clean and professional format:** Keep the layout simple and easy to read. Use a professional font, bullet points, and clear headings to make your resume visually appealing.

3. **Emphasize your skills:** Highlight your technical skills, especially those relevant to the job you're applying for. Include both hard (e.g., programming languages, frameworks) and soft skills (e.g., teamwork, problem-solving).

4. **Showcase projects:** Describe personal or academic projects related to frontend or full-stack development. Include details like the technologies used, your role, and the outcomes achieved.

5. **Include relevant coursework:** If you're a recent graduate, mention relevant courses, certifications, or online courses you've completed. This can help demonstrate your commitment to learning.

6. **Use action verbs:** Start each bullet point with a strong action verb (e.g., developed, designed, implemented) to describe your achievements and responsibilities.

7. **Quantify your achievements:** Whenever possible, use numbers to quantify your achievements. For example, "Increased website loading speed by 30% through optimization techniques."

8. **Tailor your resume:** Customize your resume for each job application. Highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to the specific job description.

9. **Include relevant internships or work experience:** Even if your experience is limited, any internships, part-time jobs, or freelance work related to web development should be included.

10. **Proofread carefully:** Eliminate typos and grammatical errors. Ask a friend or mentor to review your resume for feedback.

**Don'ts:**

1. **Don't include irrelevant information:** Avoid including personal information, hobbies, or details unrelated to the job. Focus on what's professionally relevant.

2. **Don't use jargon excessively:** While technical terms are essential, avoid overloading your resume with industry-specific jargon that might confuse non-technical HR professionals.

3. **Don't make it too long:** A one-page resume is generally sufficient for most entry-level positions. Avoid lengthy resumes that could overwhelm recruiters.

4. **Don't lie or exaggerate:** Be honest about your skills and experiences. It's better to showcase your genuine abilities than to make false claims.

5. **Don't use unprofessional email addresses:** Use a professional email address for contact information.

   - Full name
   - Phone number
   - Professional email address
   - LinkedIn profile
   - Location (optional)
