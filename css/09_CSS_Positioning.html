9. CSS Positioning

Task: Create a webpage with four differently positioned boxes to illustrate the concepts 
      of static, relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.

Topics covered: CSS Positioning (Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, Sticky)
-->

<!-- 
Static: The default positioning. Boxes are placed in the normal flow of the document.
Relative: Positioned relative to its normal position. The top and left properties move
          it 20px down and right from its original position.
Absolute: Positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor. The top and right 
          properties position it 20px down from the top and 20px from the right edge of
          the closest ancestor with a positioned property (body in this case).
Fixed: Positioned relative to the viewport. The bottom and right properties place it 
       20px from the bottom and 20px from the right edge of the viewport.
Sticky: The behavior of position: sticky is demonstrated by positioning the "Sticky" 
        box 20px from the top. The "Sticky" box remains in the normal flow of the document 
        until it reaches a specified scroll position (top value), at which point it becomes 
        fixed to the container.
